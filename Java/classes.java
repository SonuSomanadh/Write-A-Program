Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' 
which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. 
The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. 
Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager 
by making an object of both of these classes and print the same. */
